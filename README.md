# PickierPiglins
A datapack for Minecraft that makes piglins hate you more.

## Features
- Zombified Piglins hate when you mine Nether Gold Ore.
- Both Zombified and non-Zombified Piglins hate the sound of note blocks.
- Opening hoppers or dispensers will anger Piglins too now.
- On top of this, breaking almost any block that makes up a Bastion will cause Piglins to aggro on you. (This is what the datapack is named after!)
- The main feature of this mod is the new bell-ringing feature.
  - Ringing a bell is now the Piglins' alarm signal against players, so ringing one yourself will make all nearby Piglins aggressive.
  - However, when angry, Piglins will also ring nearby bells in order to alert nearby Piglins to your location. (This will make you glow, similar to the effect during a raid.)
